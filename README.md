## Features
* Default FOV is 90Â°
* Adjustable Zoom
* FOV effect while running

## Keybinds
* Right click     | zoom
* Scroll (Zoom)   | adjust zoom FOV

## Additional notes
* I have added an include folder with the neccesary .dll files for building so you may modify keybinds and values and won't have to spend 3 hours figuring out why it won't build. Not like that happened...
